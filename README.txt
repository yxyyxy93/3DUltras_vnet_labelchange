Overview
This README provides essential information about the utilities, dataset handling, and training scheme for the 3D U-Net model. The project is structured into several Python scripts, each serving specific functions in the overall implementation of the 3D U-Net model for volumetric segmentation.

Utilities
The project includes various utility scripts that aid in data handling, preprocessing, and model evaluation. These utilities are crucial for efficient and effective management of the model's workflow.

File Descriptions
Read_CSV.py: Handles the reading and processing of CSV files related to the dataset.
criteria.py: Contains different criteria or loss functions for model evaluation.
imgproc.py: Dedicated to image processing tasks, including normalization and augmentation.
utils.py: Provides general-purpose utility functions for the project.
Dataset Handling (dataset.py)
This script manages the dataset, offering functionality for loading, preprocessing, and augmenting the data.

Key Components
TrainValidImageDataset: Loads and processes training and validation datasets, supporting data augmentation and preprocessing steps.
TestDataset: Similar to TrainValidImageDataset, but tailored for handling the test dataset.
PrefetchDataLoader: Enhances data loading efficiency through data prefetching.
CPUPrefetcher and CUDAPrefetcher: Optimizes data transfer between CPU and GPU for accelerated data reading.
show_dataset_info: Displays dataset information and visualizes sample slices.
print_statistics: Outputs statistical information about the dataset for analysis.
Training Scheme for 3D U-Net Model
The training script orchestrates the model's training process, incorporating advanced techniques for optimization and performance enhancement.

Running the Training Script
Environment Setup:

Install all dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Ensure compatibility with Python 3.x and required libraries.
Configuration:

Configure config.py with appropriate settings for dataset paths, model parameters, and training configurations.
Execution:

Run the training script with the command:
css
Copy code
python [YourTrainingScriptName].py
The script manages data loading, training iterations, validation, and checkpointing.
Monitoring and Logging:

Monitor the training progress through console logs.
Optionally, use TensorBoard for detailed insights if integrated into the script.
Interruption Handling:

Press Ctrl+C to gracefully terminate the training, ensuring the current state is saved.
Key Features
Multi-Fold Training: Supports cross-validation through multiple folds of data.
Custom Data Loaders: Implements data prefetching for improved I/O performance.
Optimization Techniques: Utilizes Adam optimizer, learning rate scheduler, and AMP gradient scaling.
Model Checkpointing: Includes functionality for saving and loading model states.
Signal Handling: Ensures graceful exit and resource release upon script termination.
